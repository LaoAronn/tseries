```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#if you do not have the package, type install.packages("name_of_the_package")
library(knitr)
library(tseries)
```

### Question 1

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes

passengers <- read.csv("dat_Passengers.csv")
# head(passengers, 5)

plot(passengers$DOMESTIC)
```
Using the plot function on the DOMESTIC column, we see that it plots it against the index.

Ideally, I would like to have visualisation of Domestic Flights plotted against the
Year or Month instead of the Index. Furthermore, I would extend the y-axis more as
the range is a lot higher and I would prefer smaller points such that we have less 
overlapping data points.

(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
is.ts(passengers)

x <- ts(passengers$TOTAL, 
        start = c(2002, 10),
        frequency = 12)    

is.ts(x)
```


(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
plot(x,
     main = "Total Number of Passengers Over Time",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Number of Passengers")

```

If we plot time series object, we cna see that plot() will use a line graph and it
extends its y-axis range more. Now, we can easily identify if there's a clear trend, if there's seasonal variation.

### Question 2

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
set.seed(100)

x2 <- rnorm(500)

x2_ts <- ts(x2)
is.ts(x2_ts)
```


(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
plot(x2_ts, 
     main = "Time Series from Standard Normal Distribution",
     ylab = "Values",
     xlab = "Time")

# Add lines + / - 1
abline(h = 1, col = "red")
abline(h = -1, col = "red")

# Expected outside + / - 1 range
2* (1 - pnorm(1)) * 500 
sum(abs(x2_ts) > 1)
159/500 # Or 2* (1 - pnorm(1))
```

I would expect 31.8% or 159 out of the 500 obsesrvation to be outside of the
+ / - 1 range

(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```



### More information on R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, which can be used as a template for STAT 443 labs and assignments. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Using the function *kable*, it produces a nicer table
```{r}
kable(summary(cars))
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that specifying `echo = FALSE` parameter would prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. This is something you may want to do for larger reports that would not require display of the R code.

You can also modify the size and alignment of the figure.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="title",fig.align='center',fig.height=6,fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```
