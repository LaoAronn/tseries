```{r setup, include=FALSE}

#if you do not have the package, type install.packages("name_of_the_package")
library(knitr)
library(tseries)
library(zoo)
```

### Question 1
Without using any mathematical notation, describe in words what it means for a time series to be stationary. 

For a time series, it's stochastic process is called stationary if its mean is 
constant. Another way we can determine its stationarity is by observing its 
plotted data and see a consistent behaviour overtime.



### Question 2
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
data <- read.csv("lab4data.csv")
ts_data <- ts(data[,1]) 

plot(ts_data, 
     main = "Time Series Plot",
     ylab = "Values",
     xlab = "Time")

adf_test <- adf.test(ts_data)
print(adf_test)
```
Based on our time series plot, a constant positive slope indicating a trend, 
hence the mean is changing over time and we may consider it as non-stationary.

### Question 3




### Question 4

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```


(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```


(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```



### More information on R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, which can be used as a template for STAT 443 labs and assignments. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Using the function *kable*, it produces a nicer table
```{r}
kable(summary(cars))
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that specifying `echo = FALSE` parameter would prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. This is something you may want to do for larger reports that would not require display of the R code.

You can also modify the size and alignment of the figure.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="title",fig.align='center',fig.height=6,fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```
