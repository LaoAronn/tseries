### Question 1

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
souvenir <- scan("souvenir.txt")

souvenir_ts <- ts(souvenir,
                  start = c(1987, 1),
                  end = c(1993, 12),
                  frequency = 12)

train_data <- window(souvenir_ts, 
                     start = c(1987, 1),
                     end = c(1993, 1))

test_data <- window(souvenir_ts,
                    start=c(1993, 2),
                    end=c(1993, 12))



plot(souvenir_ts, 
     main = "Monthly Sales of Souvenir Shop", 
     ylab = "Sales (A$)",
     xlab = "Time")

acf(souvenir_ts, main = "Sample ACF of Souvenir Sales")


```
There is a seasonal effect as we can see consistent periodic spikes in the monthly sales. We also see that
the size of the spikes increase over time and is not consistently the same size which suggests a multiplicative
model.


(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
holt_model <- HoltWinters(souvenir_ts, seasonal = "multiplicative")
holt_model

plot(holt_model,
     main = "Holt-Winters Filtering: Souvenir Sales",
     ylab = "Sales (A$)",
     xlab = "Time")
```


(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
temp <- read.csv("ww4.csv")

```
