### Question 1
(a & b)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("q1a.jpg")
```

(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Calculate the spectral density
spectral_density <- function(omega) {
  term2 <- (15/18) * ((-0.4*cos(omega) - 0.16) / (1.16 + 0.8 * cos(omega)))
  term3 <- (21/18) * ((0.5*cos(omega) - 0.25) / (1.25 - cos(omega)))
  
  return((1/pi) * (1 + term2 + term3))
}

# Create a sequence of frequencies from 0 to pi
omega <- seq(0, pi, length.out = 1000)

# Calculate the spectral density for each frequency
spec_values <- sapply(omega, spectral_density)

# Create a data frame for plotting
spec_df <- data.frame(
  omega = omega,
  frequency = omega/(2*pi),
  spectral_density = spec_values
)


# Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(spec_df, aes(x = omega, y = spec_values)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Spectral Density : AR(2) Process",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "f(w)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
We can the spectral density being dominated by low frequencies, with 
the spectral density is at highest at frequency = 0 as it's peak.
As we move further away from frequency 0, we observe
a dip / decreasing spectral density and another smaller peaks
at approximately frequency 3. Overall, this suggests that
our AR(2) process has long term dependencies.


### Question 3

(a) 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
predator<- read.csv("predator_prey.csv")

rot_ts <- ts(predator$rotifers..animals.ml.)

plot(rot_ts,
     main = "Rotifer Population Over Time",
     ylab = "Population Density (Animals / ML)"
     )
```

We observe a consistent fluctuation until at time ~350 where we
observe a large spike / peak before dropping back to the consistent
fluctuation.

(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}

raw_spec <- spectrum(rot_ts,
                     log = "no",
                     main = "Raw Periodogram of Rotifer Time Series")

frequencies <- raw_spec$freq
spectrum_values <- raw_spec$spec

# Get the max 
max_index <- which.max(spectrum_values)

dominant_freq <- frequencies[max_index]
dominant_freq

angular_freq <- 2 * pi * dominant_freq
angular_freq

wavelength_days <- 1 / dominant_freq
wavelength_days
```
For our dominating frequency 0.144, we get wavelength (days) ~ 6.944
and angular frequency ~ 0.905

(c)
```{r, echo=TRUE}

N <- length(rot_ts)

num_cycles <- N / wavelength_days
num_cycles

```
On a cycle length of approximately 7 days, we get the predator prey 
cycles to be approximately 52.7

(d)
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height = 7}
spec_smooth <- spec.pgram(rot_ts, 
                          spans = c(366 / 40), # As per piazza response @116
                          log = "no",
                          main = "Smoothed Periodogram Rotifer Population")
```
We may want to change the raw periodogram since we know it is not a
consistent estimator of the spectral density function and change it
to an estimator that is more consistent. As per piazza response @116, 
I chose N / 40 over 2 *sqrt(N) for my span smoothing because I believe
it includes several peaks and dips relatively better.

(e)

```{r, echo=TRUE}

N <- length(rot_ts) # 366

omega_59 <- (2 * pi * 59) / N 
omega_59

```
Our Fourier Frequency for p = 59 is 1.012863.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```

(g)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```

(h)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
