```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#if you do not have the package, type install.packages("name_of_the_package")
library(knitr)
library(tseries)
library(zoo)
```

### Question 1

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes

q1a <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = c(-1.3, 0.4)), n = 1000, sd = sqrt(0.1))

plot(q1a, xlab = "Value", ylab = "Time")
```


(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
q1a_ts <- ts(q1a)
acf(q1a, main = "ACF")

sample2 <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = c(-1.3, 0.4)), n = 1000, sd = sqrt(0.1))
sample2_ts <- ts(sample2)
acf(sample2_ts, main = "ACF")

sample3 <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = c(-1.3, 0.4)), n = 1000, sd = sqrt(0.1))
sample3_ts <- ts(sample3)
acf(sample3_ts, main = "ACF")

sample4 <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = c(-1.3, 0.4)), n = 1000, sd = sqrt(0.1))
sample4_ts <- ts(sample4)
acf(sample4_ts, main = "ACF")
```

There is a significant decrease to a negative ACF at lag 1 then we can see a 
steady increase and decrease of ACF values after lag 1.
(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```


### Question 2

(a) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```


(b)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```


(c)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# this is where your R code goes
```



### More information on R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, which can be used as a template for STAT 443 labs and assignments. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Using the function *kable*, it produces a nicer table
```{r}
kable(summary(cars))
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that specifying `echo = FALSE` parameter would prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. This is something you may want to do for larger reports that would not require display of the R code.

You can also modify the size and alignment of the figure.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="title",fig.align='center',fig.height=6,fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```
