### Question 1


```{r, echo=TRUE}
temp <- read.csv("TempPG.csv")

summer <- temp[, c("Year", "Summer")]

summer_ts <- ts(summer$Summer, 
                start = min(summer$Year), 
                frequency = 1)

summer_ar <- arima(summer_ts,
                   order = c(2, 0, 0)
                  )
summer_ar
```
Y_t = ar1 Y_t-1 + ar2 Y_t-2 + E

$$
Y_t = 0.4297*Y_{t-1} + 0.3466*Y_{t-2} + 7.1615
